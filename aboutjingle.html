<p class = "descript">The inspiration for "Jingle Jingle" came from me (Luis Ornelas). Im a huge car enthusiast/nerd,
    thats also heavily interested in car radios. In the car world, radios are refered to as "double dins" or "headunits". The main idea for Jingle Jingle was
    to actually come up with an idea to replace a certain prodcut in Japan called a "Melody Box". This is simply just a small audio box that 
    is powered by a usb. This small box randomly plays pre-set short audio clips.
    There are certain vendors who sell such melody box, however they are heavily overpriced ($70+). Although a very simplifed version, Jingle Jingle seeks to
    eliminate the need for such expensive product by being able to be used on android headunits/double dins. Jingle Jingle will eventaully become a real application that is going to 
    uploaded to the Google Play Store. This will allow all android based headunits/doubled dins to run Jingle Jingle
    and be easily configurable by having customizable sounds and choosing when they will be played.
